Face Recognition Attendance System (OpenCV – LBPH)

Project Overview

This project is a Face Recognition based Attendance System developed using Python and
OpenCV. It detects and recognizes faces using the LBPH algorithm and records attendance in a
CSV file.


How It Works

1. Loads face images from dataset folder (Faces)
2. Trains LBPH face recognizer
3. Captures webcam feed
4. Detects faces using Haar Cascade
5. Recognizes faces and marks attendance


Technologies Used

Python, OpenCV, NumPy, CSV, Datetime, OS
Requirements
opencv-python
opencv-contrib-python
numpy

Output
Attendance is saved in a date-wise CSV file with name and time.

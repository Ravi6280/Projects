📜 How It Works

User enters text in the terminal

Python sends the text to PowerShell

PowerShell uses System.Speech.Synthesis

Computer speaks the entered text

Typing exit stops the program

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Ensure Python is Installed

Check:

python --version

2️⃣ Run the Script
python robospeaker.py

3️⃣ Usage
Enter what you want to speak: Hello World
Enter what you want to speak: How are you?
Enter what you want to speak: exit

🧠 Sample Code
import os

print("Welcome to RoboSpeaker 1.1. Created by Palak Sindhi")

while True:
    x = input("Enter what you want to speak (type 'exit' to quit): ")

    if x.lower() == "exit":
        os.system(
            'powershell -Command '
            '"Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; '
            '(New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer).Speak('
            '\'byee byee dear friend\''
            ')"'
        )
        break

    os.system(
        'powershell -Command '
        '"Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; '
        '(New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer).Speak('
        f'\\\"{x}\\\"'
        ')"'
    )

📌 Applications

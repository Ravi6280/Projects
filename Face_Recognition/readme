🧑‍💻 Face Recognition Attendance System (Python)

This project implements a real-time face recognition–based attendance system using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library.
It automatically detects faces from a webcam, recognizes known individuals, and records their attendance in a CSV file with date and time.

🚀 Features

Real-time face detection using webcam

Face recognition using pre-stored images

Automatic attendance marking

Attendance saved in date-wise CSV file

Each person is marked only once per session

Displays bounding box and name on detected face

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

OpenCV (cv2)

face_recognition

NumPy

CSV

Datetime

📜 How the System Works

Loads known face images from the Faces/ folder

Encodes faces using face_recognition

Captures live video from webcam

Matches detected faces with known encodings

Marks attendance with name and time

Saves attendance in a CSV file named with the current date

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install Required Libraries
pip install opencv-python face-recognition numpy


⚠️ On Windows, you may need CMake and Visual Studio Build Tools for dlib.

2️⃣ Add Face Images

Create a folder named Faces

Add clear, front-facing images

Name images properly (e.g., ravi.jpg, reena.jpg)

3️⃣ Run the Script
python attendance.py


Press q to stop the program.

🧠 Core Code Logic (Snippet)
matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(known_face_encodings, face_encoding)
face_distances = face_recognition.face_distance(known_face_encodings, face_encoding)
best_match_index = np.argmin(face_distances)

📌 Output

Live webcam window with face detection

Attendance saved as:

YYYY-MM-DD.csv
Name, Time
ravi, 10:12:45
reena, 10:13:02

📌 Applications

Classroom attendance system

Office employee attendance

Secure access control systems

Smart surveillance systems

⚠️ Limitations

Requires good lighting conditions

Accuracy depends on image quality

Not suitable for large crowds without optimization

🔮 Future Improvements

Add database support (MySQL / Firebase)

Mask detection support

GUI using Tkinter / PyQt

Cloud-based attendance storage

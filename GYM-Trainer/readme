# 🏋️‍♂️ GYM-Trainer – AI-Based Fitness Trainer

GYM-Trainer is an **AI-powered desktop fitness training application** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **pose estimation**. It helps users perform workouts correctly by tracking body posture in real time through a webcam and counting repetitions automatically — **no gym equipment required**.

This project is ideal for:

* Beginners learning correct exercise posture
* Home workout enthusiasts
* Students exploring **Computer Vision + Fitness AI**

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎥 **Real-time pose detection** using webcam
* 🔢 **Automatic rep counting**
* 🧍 **Posture & angle validation**
* 🏠 **No equipment exercises** (Bodyweight workouts)
* 🖥️ **GUI-based application** using Tkinter
* 📂 Modular & scalable project structure

---

## 🧠 Exercises Supported

### 🦵 Legs

* Squat
* Lunge
* Wall Sit
* Glute Bridge
* Calf Raise

### 💪 Arms *(if added)*

* Bicep Curl
* Tricep Extension

### 🧘 Shoulders *(optional / extendable)*

## 🎯 How It Works

1. User selects **body part** (Legs / Arms / etc.)
2. Chooses an **exercise** from the menu
3. Webcam starts capturing video
4. AI tracks body joints and angles
5. Correct reps are counted automatically

---

## ➕ Adding a New Exercise

1. Open `exercises/` folder
2. Add a new exercise class (example: `PushUp`)
3. Implement angle logic & rep counter
4. Register the exercise in `EXERCISE_MAP`
5. It will appear automatically in the GUI

---

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)

*Add screenshots of GUI, workout screen, and pose detection here.*

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

* 📊 Workout history & progress tracking
* 🔊 Voice feedback for posture correction
* 📱 Mobile / Web version
* 🧠 ML-based form accuracy scoring

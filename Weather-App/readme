🌦️ Weather Voice Assistant using Python

This project fetches real-time weather information for a given city using a Weather API and announces the temperature using Windows Text-to-Speech (SAPI).

🚀 Features

Takes city name as user input

Fetches real-time temperature data

Displays temperature in Celsius

Speaks the weather information aloud

Simple and beginner-friendly

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Requests (API calls)

JSON

pywin32 (win32com.client) for text-to-speech

WeatherAPI

⚠️ Works on Windows only (uses SAPI voice engine)

📜 How It Works

User enters a city name

Program sends request to Weather API

Temperature is extracted from JSON response

Temperature is printed on screen

Computer speaks the weather information

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install Required Libraries
pip install requests pywin32

2️⃣ Get Weather API Key

Sign up at weatherapi.com

Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the code

url = f"https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q={city}"

3️⃣ Run the Script
python weather_speaker.py

🧠 Sample Output
Enter the name of the city: Delhi
Temperature in Delhi: 32°C


🔊 “The current weather in Delhi is 32 degrees Celsius”

🧠 Core Code Logic
wdic = json.loads(r.text)
w = wdic["current"]["temp_c"]

speak = speech.Dispatch("SAPI.SpVoice")
text = f"The current weather in {city} is {w} degrees Celsius"
speak.Speak(text)

📌 Applications

Voice-based weather assistants

Smart desktop assistants

Accessibility tools

IoT weather announcements

⚠️ Limitations

Windows-only

Requires internet connection

API key exposure (should use environment variables)

🔮 Future Improvements

Add weather conditions (rain, humidity, wind)

GUI interface

Error handling for invalid city

Cross-platform TTS (pyttsx3)

Voice input support
